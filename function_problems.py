# Be sure to comment all your functions as shown in notes

#PROBLEM 1 (how many upper case - 4pts)
# Make a function takes a string as a parameter, then prints how many upper case letters are contained in the string.
# A loop that compares each letter to the .upper() or .lower() of itself will suffice.
# Make a call to that function using "Francis W. Parker" as the parameter (it should print "3")

# PROBLEM 2 (Biggest, smallest, average - 4pts)
# Make a function which takes 3 numbers as parameters.
# The function then prints the largest, the smallest, and their average, rounded to 2 decimals.
# Display the answers in a "nicely" formatted way.
# Make a call to your function.

# PROBLEM 4 (add me, multiply me - 4pts)
# Make a function which takes in two integers and RETURNS their sum AND their product.
# Make a call to the function, capture the product and sum as variables, and print each.

# PROBLEM 5 (Login - 4pts)
# Make a login function which works according to the flow diagram PasswordFlowchart.png in this folder
# Substitute your name for Rohan's, and use whatever generic password you want.
# Make a call to the function.

# PROBLEM 6 (main - 4pts)
# Create a main program using the format if __name__ == "__main__": 
# Place every call from problems 1 through 5 into this program.
